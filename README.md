## Project Objective

This project aims to detect image tampering or fabrication (e.g., splicing) by combining **Error Level Analysis (ELA)** with **Deep Learning** techniques, specifically using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

---

## Methodology

1. **Error Level Analysis (ELA):** Highlights regions in an image that may have been digitally altered by analyzing compression artifacts.  
2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):** Classifies images based on ELA-processed input to determine authenticity.
